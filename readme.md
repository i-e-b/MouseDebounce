MouseDebounce
=============

This is not my code -- it came from
http://www.danieljackson.co.uk/fun/old/

I'm preserving it here because it is useful to me. Runs on Windows 7.

Building
----------
Open the solution in VS and build. Move the DLL and EXE into a direcotory together and trigger the EXE to run at system start-up. It will run in the background.

Why?
----------

My Wacom tablet is a great help with RSI, but occasionally sends false double-click events. This uses a Windows mouse hook to reject them.
